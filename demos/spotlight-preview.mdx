Use code fences

```js
console.log();
```

Works by default with [many](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md) languages.

```pascal
program Hello;
begin
  writeln ('Hello, world.');
end.
```

Use `focus` to show the code that's important to the reader

```pascal focus=3
program Hello;
begin
  writeln ('Hello, world.');
end.
```

You can specify a list of line numbers

```pascal focus=2,4
program Hello;
begin
  writeln ('Hello, world.');
end.
```

And also columns

```pascal focus=1,3[11:27]
program Hello;
begin
  writeln ('Hello, world.');
end.
```
