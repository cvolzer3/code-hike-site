Sometimes it is useful to reference code from a section of text. Since the code may be below or above the text, we need to wrap the text and the code inside an element: _`<CH.Section>`_.

With the `<CH.Section>` component you can reference code in two ways:

- [Inline code](#inline-code)
- [Code mentions](#code-mentions)

## Inline code

With Code Hike, you have two options to render inline code:

- You can use the standard markdown syntax where you wrap the code in backticks: `` `var x = 10` ``, which won't be syntax-highlighted.
- Or use a special syntax where you wrap the code with underscores and backticks: _`` _`var x = 10`_ ``_, which will be syntax-highlighted as _`var x = 10`_.

Usually, the syntax depends on the context and the language. If you use the special inline code inside a `<CH.Section>` component, Code Hike will copy the highlighting from the code to the text:

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx mark=8[11:30]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-section-1.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-section-1"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

## Code mentions

Code mentions are a way to link code and text. We borrow the link syntax from markdown to create hoverable links to the code. It's easier to show than to explain:

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1,8[8:34],10
// from ../docs/preview/ch-section-2.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-section-2"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

The syntax is the same as a markdown link, but instead of an URL, you use `focus://` as the protocol, and then pass a [focus string](annotations#metastring-syntax).

Code mentions are useful when you have more than one file. To specify the file, you prepend the name before the focus string and separate them with a `#`:

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1,3,4,21 mark=3[20:34],4[20:33]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-section-3.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-section-3"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>
