Annotations allow you to change how the code is displayed and also to add interactivity.

<CH.Spotlight>

````mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7]
```py focus=2
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
# focus
print(4)
print(5)
```
````

There are two ways to add annotations:

---

```mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7] focus=1

```

- using the codeblock metastring

---

```mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7] focus=5

```

- using comments inside the code

</CH.Spotlight>

`focus` is only one of the possible annotations. The full list is:

- [_`focus`_](#focus-annotation): keep the targeted code bright while dimming the rest
- [_`mark`_](#mark-annotation): add a background color to the targeted tokens
- [_`withClass`_](#withClass-annotation): add a class to the targeted code
- [_`link`_](#link-annotation): add links inside the code

First let's see the syntax to target different parts of the code.

## Targeting lines and columns

<CH.Spotlight lineNumbers={true} maxZoom={1.3}>

<CH.Code>

```py
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

</CH.Code>

---

```py focus=2

```

To select a specific line, use the line number:
_`focus=2`_

---

```py focus=3:5

```

To select a range of lines use a colon:
_`focus=3:5`_

---

```py focus=5[3:6]

```

Select a range of column from a line using brackets:
_`focus=5[3:6]`_

---

```py focus=1,3:5,7[1:4,7:9]

```

Combine selectors using a comma separated list:
_`focus=1,3:5,7[1:4,7:9]`_

</CH.Spotlight>

## Comment syntax

The comment annotation is slightly different

<CH.Spotlight lineNumbers={true} maxZoom={1.3}>

```py
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

By default, comment annotations will target the next line

```py focus=4:5
123456789012345678
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
123456789012345678
// focus
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

By default, comment annotations will target the next line

```py focus=4,5,6,8
123456789012345678
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
123456789012345678
// focus(1,2,4)
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

By default, comment annotations will target the next line

```py focus=4,5,6,8
123456789012345678
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
123456789012345678
// focus(1,2[3:5],4)
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

By default, comment annotations will target the next line

```py focus=4,5,6,8
123456789012345678
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
123456789012345678
// focus[3:8]
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

</CH.Spotlight>

Currently comment annotations are only supported on c-style (_`// some comment`_) syntax or bash like syntax (_`# some comment`_). In the future, all languages will be supported, you can follow [this issue](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/issues/109) for updates.

## Focus annotation

<CH.Section>

With the `focus` annotation, you can highlight a specific part of the code and dim the rest.

The other functionality of the `focus` annotation is to make sure the focused code is visible without the need to scroll.

</CH.Section>

## Mark annotation

Sometimes you want to highlight code without dimming the rest. You can use the `mark` annotation to do that.

You can use it for lines:

Or you can use inline, for tokens:

## WithClass annotation

If you want to add a CSS class to a part of the code, without the default styles of `mark`, you can use the `withClass` annotation.

`withClass` annotations can only be used as comments.

## Link annotation

<CH.Section>

You can add links inside the code using the `link` annotation.
The link URL could be [external](focus://2,3[7:14]) or [internal](focus://4,5[10:17]).

```py
function lorem() {
  // link[7:14] https://codehike.org
  # link[7:14] https://codehike.org
  let codehike = "be great";
  // link[10:17] #mark-annotation
  # link[10:17] #mark-annotation
  return codehike
}
```

`link` annotations can only be used as comments and with the column syntax (`link[x:y]`).
