Annotations allow you to change how the code is displayed and also to add interactivity.

<CH.Spotlight>

````mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7]
```py focus=2
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
# focus
print(4)
print(5)
```
````

There are two ways to add annotations:

---

```mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7] focus=1

```

- using the codeblock metastring

---

```mdx mark=1[7:13],5[1:7] focus=5

```

- using comments inside the code

</CH.Spotlight>

`focus` is only one of the possible annotations. The current list of stable annotations is:

- [_`focus`_](#focus-annotation): keep the targeted code bright while dimming the rest
- [_`mark`_](#mark-annotation): add a background color to the targeted tokens
- [_`withClass`_](#withClass-annotation): add a class to the targeted code
- [_`link`_](#link-annotation): add links inside the code

First let's see the syntax to target different parts of the code.

## Metastring syntax

Some examples:

<CH.Spotlight lineNumbers={true} maxZoom={1.3}>

<CH.Code>

```py
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

</CH.Code>

---

```py focus=1

```

_`focus=1`_ selects the first line

---

```py focus=3:5

```

_`focus=3:5`_ selects the range of lines 3 to 5

---

```py focus=7[7:9]

```

_`focus=7[7:9]`_ selects the columns 7 to 9 of the seventh line

---

```py focus=1,3:5,7[1:4,7:9]

```

_`focus=1,3:5,7[1:4,7:9]`_ combines the above examples

</CH.Spotlight>

## Comment syntax

The syntax for comment annotations is slightly different.

<CH.Spotlight maxZoom={1.3}>

```py
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

_`// focus`_ selects the line after the comment

```py focus=5:6
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
// focus
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

_`// focus(1,3)`_ selects the first and third line after the comment

```py focus=5,6,8
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
// focus(1,3)
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

_`// focus[3:8]`_ selects the columns 3 to 8 of the line after the comment

```py focus=5,6[3:8]
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
// focus[3:8]
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

---

_`// focus(1,3[3:8])`_ selects the next line and the columns 3 to 8 of the third line after the comment

```py focus=5,6,8[3:8]
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
// focus(1,3[3:5])
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
123456789012345678
```

Currently, we don't support comment syntaxes for several programming languages. The two supported are: _`// comment`_ for C-style languages and the _`# comment`_ for python, bash, etc. In the future, all languages will be supported, you can follow [this issue](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/issues/109) for updates.

## `focus` annotation

<CH.Section>

With the `focus` annotation, you can highlight a specific part of the code and dim the rest.

The other functionality of the `focus` annotation is to make sure the focused code is visible without the need to scroll.

</CH.Section>

## `mark` annotation

Sometimes you want to highlight code without dimming the rest. You can use the `mark` annotation to do that.

You can use it for lines:

````md
```py
print("This is Code Hike")
# mark
print("This is Code Hike")
print("This is Code Hike")
```
````

```py
print("This is Code Hike")
# mark
print("This is Code Hike")
print("This is Code Hike")
```

Or you can use inline, for tokens:

````md
```py
# mark[16:24]
print("This is Code Hike")
```
````

```py
# mark[16:24]
print("This is Code Hike")
```

If you want to change the background or any other style, you can pass a CSS class to the annotation:

<CH.Code>

````md your.mdx
```py
# mark[16:24] my-colors
print("This is Code Hike")
```
````

---

```css your.css
.my-colors {
  background: #f00 !important;
}
```

</CH.Code>

```py
# mark[16:24]
print("This is Code Hike")
```

## `withClass` annotation

If you want to add a CSS class to a part of the code, without the default styles of `mark`, you can use the `withClass` annotation.

`withClass` annotations can only be used as comments.

## `link` annotation

<CH.Section>

You can add links inside the code using the `link` annotation.
The link URL could be [absolute](focus://2,3[7:14]) or [relative](focus://4,5[10:17]).

```py
function lorem() {
  // link[7:14] https://codehike.org
  # link[7:14] https://codehike.org
  let codehike = "be great";
  // link[10:17] #mark-annotation
  # link[10:17] #mark-annotation
  return codehike
}
```

`link` annotations can only be used as comments and with the column syntax (`link[x:y]`).
