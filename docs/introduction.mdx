Code Hike is a remark plugin for MDX. It will help you display code on your websites.

- Display code blocks, using **VS Code themes** for syntax highlighting and support for [<LangCount/> programming languages](codeblocks#languages).
- Use Code Hike **components and annotations** to enhance the **code-reading experience** and embrace the web as the interactive medium it is.
- Good-looking **default styles**. Customizable using CSS.
- And always keeping the MDX syntax as close to markdown as possible for a better **authoring experience**.

## Limitations

- It only works with MDX v2 (or xdm).
- Even when you can use MDX with frameworks like View or Svelte, Code Hike can only be used with React.
- Code Hike components are meant to be used from MDX files. It's a bad idea to import them directly from React code.
