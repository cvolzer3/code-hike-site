With _`<CH.Code>`_ you can show code files in [tabs](#tabs) or [panels](#panels). You can also pass props to [override configuration](#override-configuration) or [customize styling](#styling-props).

## Tabs

When you include more than one code blocks inside a _`<CH.Code>`_, Code Hike will show them as tabs.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-1.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-1"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

## Panels

You can also show two files at the same time in two panels. Use a divider _`---`_ to separate the top tabs from the bottom tabs.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1,7,13
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-2.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-2"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

## Override configuration

You can override some of the [configuration](configuration) options by passing props to _`<CH.Code>`_.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1,9 mark=1[10:27]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-3.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-3"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

## Styling props

Then there are the _`style`_ and _`className`_ props. You can use them to customize the styles of the component.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1,9 mark=1[10:30]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-4.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-4"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

## Height

<CH.Section>

By default, `<CH.Code>` will take the height needed to fit all the lines of the given code. As we saw in the previous example, you can use CSS to set a fixed height.

Instead of setting the height with CSS, you can also use the _`rows`_ prop. You pass the number of lines you want to show, and Code Hike will set the height accordingly.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1 mark=1[10:17]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-5.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-5"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

</CH.Section>

<CH.Section>

In addition to the number of lines, you can also pass _`"focus"`_, then the height of the code will match the height of the focused lines.

<SideBySide>

```mdx your.mdx focus=1 mark=1[10:21]
// from ../docs/preview/ch-code-6.mdx
```

<CH.Preview
  show="/docs/preview/ch-code-6"
  style={{
    margin: "0 -16px",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

</SideBySide>

</CH.Section>
