Line numbers are turned off by default (I'm not a fan of line numbers). You can turn them on by setting _`lineNumbers: true`_.

```js
mdxOptions = {
  remarkPlugins: [
    [
      remarkCodeHike,
      {
        theme: someTheme,
        // focus
        // mark[22:25]
        // label but do you really need line numbers?
        lineNumbers: true,
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```
